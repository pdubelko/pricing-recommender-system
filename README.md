Leveraging the Ticketmaster API for data to perform pricing predictions

Final project for Web Mining & System Recommenders course. Drew inspiration from highly publicized Ticketmaster Taylor Swift Era's tour ticket sales debacle. Dataset was obtained primarily using Ticketmaster's developer API with additional features pulled from Spotify. 

Leveraged LightGBM, Linear, Ridge, and Gamma Regression models in price prediction using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an evaluation metric.

Full jupyternotebook seems to be lost in the wind, but read up on my analysis in the pdf.
